The aim of the project is too peform robust image registration to aggregate continous frames of a short clip to get a dramatized final image output. The continous frames have camera shake between frames with a stationary background and moving objects. 
By analyzing optical flow and executing image processing techniques, we obtain final output. Frame interpolation can produce smoother results but wasn't utilized for KPI time requirements.
